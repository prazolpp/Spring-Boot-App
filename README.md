Swiping Sammmies Android Application

version: 1.0

- The android workspace is very easy to get everything installed and ready to go.
- The link found [Here](https://developer.android.com/studio) is where to install Android Studio.
- It is important to note that while the emulator CAN run on an AMD Processor based system, it is highly reccomended
  that this is only ran on an Intel based system.
- Once Android Studio is downloaded, go through the steps for installing and make sure the emulator is being installed as    
  well.
- Next, open up the Android Workspace filetree in Android Studio and click run. The emulator will take a few minutes to
  "turn on."

  backend is turned on before launching the app.
