SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1) In order to work on this project you need to have the following downloaded and installed if you haven't already:
- MySQL Workbench
- Android Studio
- Intellij IDEA (that's what most of us use)
- Gradle 
- Postman or Insomnia (to test the backend features)

2) Git clone this project to your device. 
3) Create your own branch (or use an existing one by consulting with the team) 

After working on the feature, if you want to test it: 
1) Open your MySql workbench and start the server at port no 3306 (default).
2) Run the java file to start the server and open postman 


If you have problems with running your server, check if your Java version is greater than or equal to 8. 
Also, check the application properties file, and see if the required information is present. Sometimes the password may not
match that of your MySql database so look out for that. 

If you have further questions, reach out to the group members.
